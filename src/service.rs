/// # use anyhow::Error;
/// # use examine::{examine_service_server::*, service::Examine};
/// # use tonic::transport::Server;
/// # use std::net::SocketAddr;
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
///     let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?;
///     let service = ExamineServiceServer::new(Examine {});
///
///     // (Commented out so that the doc-tests don't block running an actual server)
///     // Server::builder().add_service(service).serve(addr).await?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
